# SimpleText
***SimpleText*** is a software written in C++ using ***openframeworks*** library. It is developed for an interactive installation/performance in which users will establish anonymous conversations with each other through sending SMS messages to ***SimpleText*** with their desired content. Messages will get passed through our SMS Gateway and sent to ***SimpleText*** application through HTTP. Each message will promptly appear on a big screen ( visible to all the viewers ) as well as an image that's been retrieved from an instant image search in public internet. As the participants have no control over the images pulled over the screen, the setup will create an indeterministic  narrative. Both the users and public internet records play a role in leading the conversation. 

This project was developed for [Jonah Brucker-Cohen](http://www.coin-operated.com/), initially for a display at NYC Media Lab 2014.

#### From Jonah's Website

SimpleTEXT is a collaborative audio/visual public performance that relies on audience participation through input from mobile devices such as phones, PDAs or laptops. SimpleTEXT focuses on dynamic input from participants as essential to the overall output. The performance creates a dialogue between participants who submit messages which control the audiovisual output of the installation. These messages are first parsed according to a code that dictates how the music is created, and then rhythmically drive a speech synthesizer and a picture synthesizer in order to create a compelling, collaborative audiovisual performance. SimpleTEXT was originally funded by a commission from Low-Fi, a new media arts organization based in the UK.

SimpleTEXT was designed / performed / and implemented Jonah Brucker-Cohen, Duncan Murphy, [Tim Redfern](http://www.eclectronics.org/)

New version built by [Saman Tehrani](http://samantehrani.com/)
